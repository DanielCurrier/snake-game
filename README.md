# Snake 2 how to play:

## Description
Our team was tasked with creating a unique webpage utilizing various programing languages such as HTML CSS and Javascript. we decided on creating a unique take on the classic video game called snake. snake is a game in which the player uses the arrow keys to maneuver a snake around a board to collect fruit. The object of the game is to collect enough fruit to make the “snake” grow as large as possible without colliding into itself or other obstacles.
we improved upon the original concept by utilizing some web api's that allowed us to gather and push information about actual snakes in our game, in order to make playing the game both enjoyable and educational.
