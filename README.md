# Snake 2: 2 Snakes 2 Furious

## Description
Our team was tasked with creating a unique webpage utilizing various programing languages such as HTML CSS and Javascript. We decided on creating a unique take on the classic video game called snake. Snake is a game in which the player uses the arrow keys to maneuver a snake around a board to collect fruit. The object of the game is to collect enough fruit to make the “snake” grow as large as possible without colliding into itself or other obstacles.
We improved upon the original concept by utilizing some web apis, namely Howler.js and MediaWiki, that allowed us to add music to the game itself, in addition to gathering and pushing information about actual snakes in our game, in order to make playing the game both enjoyable and educational.

## Usage
To use this program, navigate to the webpage using the given URL. Upon clicking you will be directed to the home page. You will be presented with two buttons titled, Play Game and High Scores.

Click on the play button to begin the game. Use the arrow keys to navigate your snake on the game board and eat the apples. Once you eat an apple, you will be awarded with 10 points. The more you eat, the higher your score will be. If you touch the edge of the screen or eat your own tail, the game will end and you will be redirected to the end page. At the bottom of the page, there is an option to have scripted music play in the background as you game, with an additional stop button if you choose otherwise, the choice is yours! 

Once you reach the end page, you will be provided with your final score and a "Snake Rating", which will tell you which snake you have earned at your score level and a bit of info about it using a generated description from its corresponding wikipedia page. Type in your name and hit the save button to save your score.

If you would like to see your score along with other players on your local device, click on the high scores button to see where you stand!

If you would like to see what is under the hood, use Chrome DevTools to inspect the page.
